Message:  1011
<ce> You notice an axe on the ground. It seems to be made for woodcutting,
<ce> though if you were really desperate, it could also serve as a weapon.
<ce> If you felt any confidence in lumberwork, you could take it with you.
<ce> Do you take it?

Message:  1012
<ce> You leave the axe alone. Someone else will
<ce> make gainful employ with it.

Message:  1013
<ce> You pick up the axe and inspect it.
<ce> It looks fine enough for the job.
<ce> As long as you're in any place with trees nearby,
<ce> it should provide you with a reasonable income.
<ce>
<ce> (NOTE: To use the axe,
<ce> activate the "Use" command on it
<ce> in your inventory.)
