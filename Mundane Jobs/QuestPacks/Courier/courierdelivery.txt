<ce> Oh! You startled me. A letter? For me?
<ce> Um, okay. Delivery fee of =reward_ gold.
<ce> Well, here you go. Be safe.
<--->
<ce> Hello! Yes, I've been expecting that letter.
<ce> I'll take that, and you take this.
<--->
<ce> A letter? I'm not expecting any letter.
<ce> This better not be a trick.
<ce> Take your money and go.
<--->
<ce> Oh my! This must be about my mother.
<ce> I've been worried sick!
<ce> Thank you, and take this money.
<--->
<ce> Finally, some news from my beloved!
<ce> Take your money, this means so much to me.
<--->
<ce> Oh dear, another debt collection notice.
<ce> Take this money and tell no one you saw me.
<--->
<ce> A letter. This better be important.
<ce> Fighters Guild recruitment?
<ce> Are they so desperate that they send letters now?
<ce> Well, I'll get reimbursement for this delivery.
<ce> You take your =reward_ gold.
<--->
<ce> A letter for me? Wait, let me see what it says.
<ce>
 "_person_,
    You are a thief. Do not
 try to deny it, you have
 been seen in the act. There
 is honor among thieves.
 Either join the guild or
 face the consequences."
<ce>
<ce> Oh dear. Go now. Now. Take your money and hurry on.
<--->
<ce> Oh no, I've been expecting this letter. Oh dear.
<ce> Yes, my grandfather has passed away.
<ce> It's time to tie up loose ends.
<ce> Thank you. Take your fee.
<--->
<ce> A delivery for me? What?
<ce> This is just an advertisement
<ce> for a blacksmith up the way.
<ce> I'll pay you, but I'm going to raise
<ce> Oblivion with these devils for wasting
<ce> my time and money like this. Get going, now.
<--->
<ce> A letter for me? Oh wow! A birthday party!
<ce> This sounds like fun! I'll get my things in
<ce> order and make the trip. Thank you!
<ce> Here, this is yours.
<--->
<ce> Oh, the letter arrived! My sister is
<ce> doing so well with the Mages Guild,
<ce> I get so excited to hear how she's doing.
<ce> I can't wait to read it! Here, take
<ce> your money and get going.
<--->
<ce> Oh, wonderful! It's this month's letter.
<ce> My brother works for the %rt
<ce> and has so many fascinating stories to tell.
<ce> Here, take what's yours and let me read.
<--->
<ce> Another cursed letter from my estranged family.
<ce> I'll pay your fee, but they need to get their act together.
<ce> Might find an axe in their door one of these days.
<ce> Go on, scram.
<--->
<ce> Oh, thank you! This is from my sister. She's traveling
<ce> across the Bay and wanted me to know she made it safely.
<ce> What a relief! Here, take your fee.
<--->
<ce> Oh, dear. My mother has passed away, and it seems
<ce> we need to get our family business in order.
<ce> It'll be quite messy, I can say that much.
<ce> Here, take your gold.
<--->
<ce> Oh! This must be that cooking recipe I ordered
<ce> last week. How nice of them! Thank you.
<ce> Here is your gold.
<--->
<ce> Ah, I need these instructions for a potion
<ce> I'm making! How kind of you.
<ce> Here's your payment.
<--->
<ce> Oh, good! These are instructions for an
<ce> insecticide I need to make. The house
<ce> is just riddled with bugs, you see.
<ce> Here, your money, now.
<--->
<ce> This letter? It's dated from last year.
<ce> I'm amazed I'm even expected to pay
<ce> for this, but I will. Now get out of here.
<--->
<ce> Oh, my lottery ticket! I sure hope
<ce> I win this time. I'd buy some nice
<ce> new furniture with it! Here,
<ce> be off with your payment.
<--->
<ce> Yes, this is the lottery ticket
<ce> I ordered! Good. I'll be buying
<ce> a big, new chimney with it if I win!
<ce> Here, this is your payment.
<--->
<ce> A letter from my... father?
<ce> I thought he was dead! Wow, what news!
<ce> Yes, give me that! Here, your money.
<ce> Now let me read.
<--->
<ce> A letter from my nephew! How wonderful!
<ce> Let me get caught up... Oh yes, your
<ce> payment. Here, take it. Farewell.
<--->
<ce> This is... my niece is pregnant?
<ce> What news! Oh, my! I should
<ce> head over there this month.
<ce> Oh, such joy you've brought me!
<ce> Here, take your payment.
<--->
<ce> A court summons for... vagrancy?
<ce> What does that even mean?
<ce> Foul %rt. I'll see this all in court.
<ce> Take your payment, %ra.
