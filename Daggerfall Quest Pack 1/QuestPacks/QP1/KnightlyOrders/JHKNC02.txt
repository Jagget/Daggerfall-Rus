<ce> _witch_ and _friend_ embrace joyfully.
<ce> They turn to you and bow.
<ce>
<ce> "I'm sorry that I kept the truth from you,
<ce> %pcf. It is true -- I am a witch.
<ce> The guards had a lawful pursuit against me.
<ce> But I couldn't let them take my life!
<ce> You would've done the same thing in my place!"
<ce> _witch_ exclaims.
<ce>
<ce> _friend_ puts %g4 hand on her shoulder.
<ce> "It is time for us to go. I pray this
<ce> token is worthy thanks to you,
<ce> for doing the right thing,"
<ce> %g1 says. As you inspect your reward,
<ce> the two disappear from view.

Message:  1010
<ce> A dark-feathered bird of a rather strange form
<ce> drops a letter at your feet and flutters away.

Message:  1011
%pct, knight of ____home_
<ce>
  I turn to you in desperation, for I hear you are a knight of honor.
I am hiding in ___home_, within _home_.
Please escort me out of here. My life is in grave danger.
You will do the right thing, please.
I can only wait =timer_ days.
<ce>
                   _witch_

Message:  1012
<ce> %oth! You came! You're here!
<ce> Oh, by Mephala's tears, there is hope after all.
<ce> I am being pursued by evil and conspiring men
<ce> who wish to take my life. Please, do what you can
<ce> to keep me hidden. I have friends in a place
<ce> called ___dest_ who can protect me,
<ce> if you can get me to _dest_ within =2dest_ days.
<ce> I'm ready to leave now, knight.

Message:  1013
<ce> Scarcely free of _home_, you are
<ce> seen by an alarmed member of the city watch.
<ce>
<ce> "Halt! That woman is wanted for witchcraft and
<ce> consorting with daedrakind. You will surrender her immediately
<ce> and provide no resistance to her arrest!"
<ce>
<ce> _witch_ whispers, "These are the men
<ce> who will kill me! Please, get us out of here!"
<ce>
<ce> The watchman readies his axe.
<ce> Do you surrender _witch_ to him?

Message:  1014
<ce> Seeing your resistance, the guardsman runs and calls for help.
<ce> You hear much movement in the nearby area.

Message:  1015
<ce> You step back and allow the guardsman to grab _witch_.
<ce> She starts to cast a spell, but his gauntlet smashes her face
<ce> and knocks her unconscious. He binds her hands.
<ce>
<ce> "You made the right choice, knight.
<ce> These hags are too dangerous for civilization.
<ce> We'll make sure she burns before she awakens."
<ce>
<ce> You watch him carry her inert body away.

Message:  1016
<ce> "Good! We're here! Just help me find _friend_
<ce> here in the residence," _witch_ says.
<ce> "Look for a =friend_."

Message:  1018
<ce> You are spotted by a member of the city watch.
<ce> He begins to sound the alarm.
<ce>
<ce> "Halt! The witch's consort is here!
<ce> Surrender immediately and face
<ce> justice for your crimes!"

Message:  1019
<ce> You're surprised to realize _witch_
<ce> has disappeared altogether.
<ce> No trace of her remains.

Message:  1030
