<ce> We have a job here that doesn't really
<ce> fit the bill for what the Fighters Guild
<ce> was made for, but it still pays. Do
<ce> ya wanna go over to ___res_
<ce> and bring some _pick_ someone left
<ce> over there? Sounds like easy pickin's.
   <--->
<ce> We've got a request here to go over to
<ce> ___res_ and pick up something
<ce> that got left over there by accident.
<ce> Sounds simple enough. Wanna take
<ce> this one, %pcf?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce> Man, are you just here to smash skulls or what?

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce> All right, get going then. ___res_,
<ce> _res_. You're looking
<ce> for some _pick_ that they said is
<ce> gonna be on the floor. Just grab it and
<ce> there should be some instructions on
<ce> where you take it. That's what they
<ce> told me, at least. _culp_
<ce> should give you your reward after that.
<ce> I'm giving you =timer_ days to do this.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce> _questgiver_ expected you to return to
<ce> ___questgiver_ with the _pick_ by now.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce> This again? %oth. Hey, I'm really sorry
<ce> about this. We told the %t and everyone's doing
<ce> everything they can to find who's behind it.
<ce> But look, I'm not gonna let you walk away empty-handed.
<ce> Keep that _pick_ you got from them and sell
<ce> it if you want, and I'll give you =reward_ gold
<ce> out of my own pocket. It's not that much
<ce> but it's literally all I've got left over from
<ce> last week. Just know that we appreciate
<ce> how there are members like you watching
<ce> out for the rest of us.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]

Message:  1025
<ce> This month we're paying =bigsum_ for
<ce> every Fighters Guild bozo. Remember:
<ce> priorities are eyes, hearts, and lungs.
<ce> Partials mean less pay for you.

%qdt:
 The Fighters Guild has given
 me a task which apparently
 doesn't involve fighting. I'm headed
 to ___res_ to pick up
 some _pick_ inside a building,
 _res_. They'll tell
 me where to take it after that.
 I should be back in ___questgiver_
 in =timer_ or fewer days.

Message:  1031
%qdt:
 I was set up and violently ambushed.
 I should head back to ___questgiver_ and
 tell _questgiver_ about it.
