 We've got a problem. You did a contract for the Fighters
Guild to off some outlaw in ___dung_ a while ago.
After the %t sent the order and before you arrived,
the scoundrel got possessed by a kind of daedra.
It's now free of its host body, thanks to you,
and keeps assaulting ___farm_. The %t's
holding you responsible. Get on over there
within 30 days and slay it or your good name
in ____farm_'s going to lose its shine.
