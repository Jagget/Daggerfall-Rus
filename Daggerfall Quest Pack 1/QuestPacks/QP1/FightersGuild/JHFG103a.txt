<ce> Not bad. You've got some potential, I'd say.
<ce> Maybe someday we'll have a use for you.
<ce> Here's your gold. We never met.

Message:  1010
<ce> You find a letter among your belongings.

  It's kinda funny. We were watching a
supposedly "very skilled assassin" down in
some hole who we were hoping
to hire for a job. Then you come along and
kill the wretch. We accept your qualifications.
Meet me in =firsttimer_ days if you want to make
some money.

<ce> Good. I was worried you'd gotten cold feet.
<ce> Or maybe you were just one of those lunatics
<ce> that kills random people without thought for profit.
<ce> We've got someone off in a remote piece of property who
<ce> needs to die. Do it quick or someone's gonna notice
<ce> and raise the alarm on you. You in for =reward_ gold?

Message:  1013
<ce> Ah, you must merely be stupid. Goodbye.

Message:  1014
<ce> Get to ___farm_. There's a wizard who
<ce> maintains the property. Got on my nerves too
<ce> many times now. Be back here with the killing
<ce> done in =timer_ days. And if you're on the property
<ce> too long you're gonna be caught, like an idiot,
<ce> and you won't find me here.

Message:  1015
%qdt:
 I've taken up a job to slay a wizard
 residing at ___farm_.
 If I do so without getting caught, I can
 return to ___res_ for my =reward_ gold
 within =timer_ days.

Message:  1016
<ce> If this is ___farm_, then you're
<ce> sure to find the wizard here somewhere.

Message:  1017
<ce> Your mark is slain. You should hurry out of here.

Message:  1018
<ce> Screams rise from the small home, and a sense of magical
<ce> communication rushes through the air. Your deed is
<ce> now known throughout ____farm_.
