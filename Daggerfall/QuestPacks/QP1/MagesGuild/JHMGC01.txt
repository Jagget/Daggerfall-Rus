QuestFail:   [1003]
<ce> You agreed to slay the atronach
<ce> inside _res_ by now.

RumorsPostSuccess:   [1007]
Been slaying some atronach in _res_, am I right? Of course I know.

Message:  1010
<ce> As you exit the guild hall, a merchant waits nearby.
<ce> She speaks at you nervously.
<ce>
<ce> "Excuse me, you're with the mages, aren't you?
<ce> There's an atronach in my mother's house,
<ce> and no one is willing to fight it for us.
<ce> Please come and help!"
<ce>
<ce> Conspicuously absent is any promise of material gain.
<ce> Will you accept nonetheless?

Message:  1011
<ce> The merchant writes down _res_
<ce> on a piece of parchment. "It isn't far from here.
<ce> It's %di, you'll find it before long.
<ce> Please destroy the golem before this time tomorrow."
<ce> She then parts ways from you.

Message:  1012
<ce> Magical energy buzzes around you.
<ce> There's no question an atronach has been here.

Message:  1013
<ce> The enemy is slain.

Message:  1014
<ce> The merchant awaits outside, already well aware of your deed.
<ce>
<ce> "Thank you, kind %ra! %god bless you. I'll tell my merchant
<ce> friends all about you and your generosity. I have no money
<ce> to pay you, but I'll make sure my friends give you
<ce> good deals in the future."
<ce>
<ce> She then enters the house, presumably to clean
<ce> up the atronach remnants.

Message:  1015
<ce> Looking quite miffed, the merchant woman departs in silence.

Message:  1030
%qdt:
 A merchant woman in ___res_
 has asked me to dispose of a

 If I intend to do so, I should
