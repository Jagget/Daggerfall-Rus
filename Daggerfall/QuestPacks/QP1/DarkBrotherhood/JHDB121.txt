<ce> Certain works can only be entrusted to
<ce> one of your rank. We have a task of great
<ce> importance to Tamriel's future, but there
<ce> will only be one chance to execute it.
<ce> Fail, and the consequences will be severe.
<ce> But your success will bring great glory
<ce> to yourself and the Brotherhood.
<ce> Will you take it up at this time?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce> If I find someone capable first, it
<ce> will go to them. We will not wait forever.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce> Then swear to me that you will tell no
<ce> being, living or dead, what I now impart.
<ce>
<ce> An ambassador from the Imperial City has
<ce> traveled to the court of Wayrest to
<ce> "discuss the future of the Orcish race."
<ce> Populous as the greenskins are, the Emperor
<ce> commands armies sufficient to eradicate them
<ce> in their current state. That may come to pass
<ce> sooner rather than later at the instigation of
<ce> this agent, who must be slain. This petition comes
<ce> from Gortwog, lord of the orcs.
<ce>
<ce> The Brotherhood has no stake in this matter other
<ce> than that we have been hired for it. Your partner
<ce> will be a magician, another of our highest-ranking
<ce> members in %crn. She has gone ahead to
<ce> the court of Wayrest and has orders to
<ce> await you there for =timer_ days.
<ce> Look for someone inside Wayrest Palace who
<ce> asks, "How long will the Septims reign?"
<ce> Answer, "Every year they must."
<ce> Then press your thumb into her palm.
<ce> She will guide you from there.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce> Off to Wayrest, %pcf.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce> She smiles and leans in closer.

Message:  1010
<ce> The Dark Brotherhood's magician will be somewhere here.

Message:  1011
<ce> "Hello there. I haven't seen you in these parts."
<ce>
<ce> You are surprised by a voice behind you. Turning
<ce> around, you meet the piercing gaze of a woman.
<ce>
<ce> "It's so hard to find even one %ra loyal
<ce> to the Empire. What think you? How long will
<ce> the Septims reign?"
<ce>
<ce> Do you give the answer _qgiver_ told you?

Message:  1012
<ce> "Well, I must be going. Enjoy your stay in Wayrest, stranger."
<ce>
<ce> She leaves you alone and attends to other duties.
<ce> You are no longer involved in this plot.
