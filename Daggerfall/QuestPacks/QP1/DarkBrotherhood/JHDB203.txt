<ce> %pct, this task is elementary to the
<ce> point that a child could fulfill it within an hour.
<ce> We therefore have confidence that you will not
<ce> fail us in this matter. Will you slay a thief with
<ce> an overstayed welcome in ___questgiver_?
   <--->
<ce> Not all our work may be precisely termed
<ce> lawful, but at least we do it well. We have
<ce> a request to reconcile a thief who has failed
<ce> to do a proper job and yet is too stupid
<ce> to flee ___questgiver_. Will you
<ce> make reconciliation for our client?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce> If this task is too difficult for you, perhaps
<ce> the Brotherhood is the wrong place to be.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce> Then you will slay a thief, and quite an
<ce> incompetent one. It requires a special
<ce> kind of idiocy to remain in a city
<ce> when you've stolen from one of its
<ce> principal residents, and more so when
<ce> you've been spotted in the act. The
<ce> tramp apparently is paying for short-
<ce> term lodging in _thieves_.
<ce> Go there and have finished with
<ce> this in fewer than twelve hours.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce> Well done, %pct. These acts
<ce> keep the wheels of %crn
<ce> turning smoothly. Continue to
<ce> serve the Night Mother with zeal.

<ce> Moron! The only thing quicker
<ce> than my feet is my blade!

 The Dark Brotherhood has
 sent me to slay a thief
 in _thieves_.
 I have twelve hours to
 do it and return.

Message:  1041
<ce> "What?! How--"
<ce>
<ce> The thief crumples into a heap on
<ce> the floor. Your work here is done.

Message:  1099
<ce> Do you need help, %pct?
<ce> Leave this building and look for
<ce> the house. Kill the thief and then
<ce> return. Do it in that order.
