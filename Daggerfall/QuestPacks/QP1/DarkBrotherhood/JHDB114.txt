QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce> One curious request asks that we slay a particular
<ce> person and deliver the body to our client.
<ce> Smells like a necromancer to me. Is this a job
<ce> we can entrust to you?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce> Ah, because you have standards, surely.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce> Perhaps I should interject that I do not know whether
<ce> the client is actually a servant of the dark arts.
<ce> That is merely the sense this petition gives me.
<ce> The corpse must be delivered with all vital organs
<ce> intact to ___nhome_. The body must not decompose
<ce> for more than =2nhome_ days. The request calls for
<ce> _mark_, resident of ___mhome_.
<ce> I will warn you, however, that %crn's guard will not tolerate
<ce> the sight of a %ra carrying a festering corpse around. Avoid
<ce> all civilization until you have made the delivery.
<ce> The Night Mother watch over you, %pct.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce> The body has clearly decomposed beyond what the client
<ce> could have asked for. You discard it and cut your losses.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce> A robed figure spots you from within the cottage.
<ce> Soon %g1 comes out to greet you.
<ce>
<ce> "Yes? Oh, splendid. Well done, %ra. Surely a bit of payment
<ce> is in order, I say. Take this as motivation to keep quiet,
<ce> will you? I deal with people who simply cannot tolerate
<ce> this work being noised abroad. Here now, take it."

Message:  1010
<ce> "Hello, yes?"
<ce>
<ce> You catch _mark_ completely by surprise.
<ce> The killing blow follows swiftly after.

Message:  1011
<ce> You begin to carry the corpse. You should
<ce> avoid civilized areas while it's on you.

Message:  1012
<ce> You are spotted carrying _mark_'s corpse
<ce> and the alarm is raised. A few peacekeepers
<ce> come forward to carry out justice for your crime.
