QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce> One of our higher-ranking members is
<ce> the victim of a ransom plot, and we
<ce> need someone to perform a rescue.
<ce> Show your allegiance to the Brotherhood.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce> Oh, of course. What allegiance?

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce> Within ___dung_ a relative of one
<ce> of our local Dark Brothers is being held
<ce> captive. Since said family member is too
<ce> involved in a higher-level plot at this
<ce> moment, we promised to send someone capable
<ce> to resolve this matter instead. Go find
<ce> _captive_ and return here within =timer_ days.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce> I would not waste time if I were you.
<ce> _captive_ is in ___dung_.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce> Why is _captive_ not with you?
<ce> Give your report.
<ce>
<ce> I see. I believe your words.
<ce> I will pass the news on.
<ce> Mephala's wrath will keen
<ce> for such a cynical crime.

Message:  1010
<ce> You find _captive_,
<ce> but she resists your approach.
<ce>
<ce> "No! No! Leave me down here!
<ce> I don't want to go, please!"
<ce>
<ce> Some people need to be forced out
<ce> of the luxury of this squalid hole,
<ce> it seems. You pull her along with you.

Message:  1011
<ce> _captive_ shrieks as you
<ce> exit ___dung_.
<ce>
<ce> "I TOLD YOU! I TOLD YOU TO
<ce> LEAVE ME THERE! IT HURTS! NO!"
<ce>
<ce> A gruesome transformation follows,
<ce> leaving her in a very different state.
