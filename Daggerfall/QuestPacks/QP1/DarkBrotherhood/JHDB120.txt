QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce> We recently received a request from the
<ce> Mages Guild to off one of their members.
<ce> Quite official-looking. I suppose it couldn't
<ce> hurt to improve your standing among them
<ce> by taking this job, would it %pct?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce> You can have other allegiances, %ra.
<ce> We will not be jealous.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce> Good. First head to the sap's guild hall
<ce> in ___guild_. They'll explain where
<ce> to go. We don't particularly care about why
<ce> the fool needs to die; the Brotherhood
<ce> is merely happy to be the instrument, and
<ce> you are given the honor of carrying it out.
<ce> They demanded that this matter be concluded
<ce> in =timer_ days. Be sure that whoever this is
<ce> ceases breathing by then. Your contact's
<ce> name in the guild is _mage_. Farewell.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce> Did you get lost on the way to ___guild_, %pct?

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce> This matter is finished. The mages of
<ce> ___guild_ need fear no more a rogue
<ce> daedra summoner.

Message:  1010
<ce> Good day. Ah, you would be our, um, specialist!
<ce> For that one difficult matter! Please, let us
<ce> speak softly.
<ce>
<ce> We would tell you of a problem that needs solving,
<ce> and it's quite urgent. The summoning of daedra is
<ce> a task of great hazards, not to be propagated
<ce> by every last child with a desire to speak to
<ce> otherworldly forces. We of the Mages Guild do well
<ce> to restrict that power only to the responsible.
<ce> Nevertheless, we occasionally let one or another
<ce> slip through our fingers, as has happened this time.
<ce>
<ce> Our hard-headed pupil has taken refuge in a hole,
<ce> ___dung_, hoping to continue with
<ce> the daedra-baiting down there. Where this art
<ce> was learned we do not know, for a mere Journeyman
<ce> in our halls will never so be taught. Please
<ce> have finished with this menace, that we may
<ce> all rest more easily.

Message:  1011
<ce> This foe's face turns pale. A few shouts in an
<ce> arcane language follow, and one hand goes into
<ce> the pack for some kind of parchment. It quickly
<ce> starts to degrade due to an enchantment put on it.

Message:  1012
<ce> This parchment has stopped disintegrating
<ce> with the rogue mage's death, but it likely
<ce> won't last longer than a day in its current
<ce> state. If you're going to get any use from it,
<ce> it will be from memorizing its contents.

Message:  1013
A thousand thanks to thee, child. To rely on one
of the civilized world tends to invoke turmoil upon
our kind, but thou hast proven to be of an exceptional
breed. Thy name among us is well-earned.
<ce>
We see fit to grant thee direct visitation to our
sisterhood. No more need we waste time with intermediaries.
If thou wilt visit us in our coven thou shalt be as one
of us. With thine eyes, see thou the Burning Martyr of
Kynareth in the region of Daggerfall. Put the setting sun
to thy right ear and walk. Thou shalt find our altar
and our joyful reception in short order, if thou vary not
from thy course. Seek us on a plateau overlooking the sea.

 The Dark Brotherhood of ___questgiver_
 has assigned me to speak with 
 _mage_ of the Mages Guild
 in ___guild_, who will
 tell me of an accounting that must
 be rendered within =timer_ days.

Message:  1031
