QRC:

QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce> A mediocre creature living in %crn
<ce> has acquired a debt exceeding six figures,
<ce> obligating the creditors to turn to us.
<ce> Death is now the fool's only future.
<ce> You may carry it out at your leisure.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce> Looking for courier work instead?

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce> Look for the owner of _res_, found in
<ce> ___res_. Whoever it is will probably be armed
<ce> since this isn't the first time someone's
<ce> tried to settle this. Tell me the tale of
<ce> this mark's dismemberment within =timer_ days.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce> The Dark Brotherhood required your report on
<ce> the delinquent homeowner in ___res_ by now.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce> Well done. As demonstrated, we fill an important role.
<ce> Let no one swindle with impunity while we
<ce> have agents to do our work.

Message:  1010
<ce> This must be the well-armed debtor.

Message:  1011
<ce> "No! Wait! Please, don't! I'm begging you! I'll give you
<ce> anything! Here! In this box is the last bit of money
<ce> I have, =reward_ gold! Take it and please just let me live!"

Message:  1012
<ce> "Thank you! Oh, please, just give me a second. Let me put in
<ce> the combination. It'll only take so long. You can watch me,
<ce> see? I'm not going anywhere."
<ce>
<ce> The debtor turns several dials on a complex box nearby.
<ce> Soon a satisfying click bounces against the walls.
<ce>
<ce> "Okay! It's done. It'll open in sixty seconds, okay?
<ce> I'm out of here! Thank you! Goodbye!"
<ce>
<ce> You are left alone. One whole minute passes and the
<ce> box's door springs open, revealing your bribe money.

Message:  1013
<ce> Hopefully %crn's delinquents will learn
<ce> to do better than this fool did. The accounting is complete.
