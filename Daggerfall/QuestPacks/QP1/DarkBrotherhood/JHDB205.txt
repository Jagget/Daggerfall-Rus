<ce> %pct, tell me concerning yourself. Were
<ce> you to spend a night in a tavern after a long day
<ce> of merchandising, only to be awakened every six
<ce> minutes by a loud and drunk barbarian in the main
<ce> hall, would you feel it proper to approach the
<ce> Brotherhood and request some natural justice be
<ce> meted out against the clueless brute? And would
<ce> you answer a call to deliver such justice?
   <--->
<ce> %pct, I will not mince words. You, I, and every
<ce> other person in ___qgiver_ hates
<ce> barbarians. We have a petition to rid %crn
<ce> of one of them. Will you take advantage of it?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce> The Brotherhood rarely makes mistakes, and we
<ce> hope for your sake you are not one of them.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce> The only correct answer. This barbarian, staying
<ce> in _tavern_, is actually the target of multiple
<ce> contracts. If only every day were as lucrative as
<ce> this. The motives include ceaselessly bragging
<ce> about romantic conquests, debauching the
<ce> soon-to-be-married, shouting loudly in the morning
<ce> hours, and even scratching a beer glass. Apparently
<ce> the innkeeper has also grown tired of this beast.
<ce> Serve ___qgiver_ by slaying this
<ce> brute and returning here within twelve hours.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce> Failure text

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce> Good, %pct. But let this task cause
<ce> you no pride. You have yet to do
<ce> meaningful service in Mephala's favor.

Message:  1023
<ce> Ha ha ha! Sorry %ra, I'm havin' too
<ce> much fun 'ere! Maybe a good thrashing
<ce> will get some o' the beer outta me!

Message:  1024
<ce> Ha ha ha! This's rich! This %ra
<ce> is tryin' ta start a fight! Hey fellas,
<ce> get on over here an' even tha odds!

 The Dark Brotherhood has
 sent me to slay a barbarian
 in _tavern_.
 I have twelve hours to
 do it and return.

Message:  1043
<ce> "But how many more... could I have..."
<ce>
<ce> The fool's mouth shuts before
<ce> more stupidity can flow out.
<ce> Your work here is done.
