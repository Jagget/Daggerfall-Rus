QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce> We rarely ask questions concerning why certain
<ce> tasks are brought to us, and further still when
<ce> they pay well. I will tell you nothing about this
<ce> mark except that a bodyguard had to be hired
<ce> for peace of mind. Show the poor fool in
<ce> ___res_ what we think of bodyguards.
   <--->
<ce> There are times we find satisfaction in simply
<ce> proving our superiority over every other force
<ce> moving across ____res_. What name
<ce> inspires so much as half the fear as the Dark
<ce> Brotherhood among the citizenry? Yet to ensure
<ce> we remain more than a mere name, we must
<ce> overpower those who wish to thwart us.
<ce> Go to ___res_ and slay a fool who
<ce> has hired a bodyguard.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce> Perhaps you should work for the Fighters Guild
<ce> if you dislike dirtying your hands.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce> The bodyguard is of little concern to us.
<ce> Perhaps shattering its ego would provide
<ce> you more satisfaction than killing it. The
<ce> accounting is for the mark only. This
<ce> tragic duo will stay at _res_
<ce> in ___res_. Return here in
<ce> =timer_ days. Go with Mephala, %pct.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce> The Dark Brotherhood expected you
<ce> in ___questgiver_ by now.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce> Well done, %pct. And what did you
<ce> do to the incompetent guardian? A fitting
<ce> resolution. The Night Mother will be pleased.

Message:  1019
<ce> You step into _res_,
<ce> watching for this so-called bodyguard.

Message:  1020
<ce> The acrobat collapses in defeat.
<ce> The contract is fulfilled.

Message:  1025
<ce> You step into _res_ and are
<ce> accosted by a voice coming from thin air.
<ce>
<ce> "%ra, cease. I can see your doings.
<ce> The one you seek is under my protection.
<ce> Continuing your fruitless mission will
<ce> engender my wrath. Do not understimate me."
   <--->
<ce> You step into _res_ and are
<ce> accosted by a voice coming from thin air.
<ce>
<ce> "Stop. The one you seek is my ward and
<ce> I will avenge thirtyfold any injury
<ce> you produce. Turn and leave now,
<ce> lest you face my wrath."

Message:  1026
<ce> The voice you previously heard returns.
<ce>
<ce> "You cannot comprehend what you have done.
<ce> Your life is forfeit. Suffer for your deed."
   <--->
<ce> The voice you previously heard returns.
<ce>
<ce> "Your end is come. Nothing can repay the
<ce> crime you have committed. You will die, worm."

 The Dark Brotherhood has sent
 me from ___questgiver_ to
 ___res_ to look for an
 fool and a bodyguard, who hide
 in _res_. I must at

 =timer_ days for recognition.
