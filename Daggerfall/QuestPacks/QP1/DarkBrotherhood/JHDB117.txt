QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce> For some reason there's an incessant demand for
<ce> research notes related to the mundane sciences.
<ce> Our client demands that these notes be gathered for
<ce> an undisclosed purpose, and the Brotherhood is to
<ce> obtain them by any means necessary. Where bribery
<ce> fails, we send one such as yourself. Your task will
<ce> be to kill the courier and take the Mages Guild's notes.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce> What a surprise.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce> Then the contract is yours. Your obligation is both
<ce> the murder of the courier and the delivery of the
<ce> document, for we wish to show the end of those who
<ce> resist our generous offers. Seek out _dummymg_,
<ce> wherever %g1 may be, and bring the research here
<ce> within =timer_ days' time. Glory to the Night Mother.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce> _qgiver_ wanted the research notes by now.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce> Let me see the document. Hmm. Very well.
<ce> I remain ignorant of the urgency our patron
<ce> feels for these essays, but such concerns exceed
<ce> my capacity to care. Your work is done, %pct.

Message:  1010
<ce> Hey! No! Someone help! Please!
   <--->
<ce> No! I'm dying! Help! Help!

Message:  1011
<ce> This paper contains the research _qgiver_ wanted.

That darn fool's always running around ___place_.

_courier_'s wasting %g3 life, I say.

_courier_? Who's that?

The manner by which the diastolic pressure
 of any two scarce commodities (creating a
 type of propulsion with no moving parts
 and virtual silence) has been postulated
 by thyrionic mathematicians for many years.
 In conventional thinking, the default
 parameters of any formula (objectively
 speaking, it is essential to remember that
 objectivity is indeed subjective) will
 always return to what Mornthaur called the
 "back medium." However, starting with a
 grid of complex numbers that more than covers
 the unit circle and three cube roots of one,
 we can backtrace, by uptracking the negative
 "half numbers," and create an infinite basin
 with dual natures of blackness and whiteness.
 The rate of adiabatic cooling or warming in
 unsaturated air can thus be made directly
 proportional to the fourth power of its
 absolute temperature.

<ce> A fellow in nondescript clothing presses
<ce> a note into your hand and departs.

Message:  1015
%ra in the service of the Dark Brotherhood
 
 I greet you in the name of the King of Worms.
 We appear to have a common interest in the notes
 held by the scholar _dummymg_.
 Your loyalty to the Dark Brotherhood is admirable,
 but remember that such things have their end.
 The time will come that they turn to slay you as
 they do all their useful pawns. You may save yourself
 from your blind loyalty bringing the research to
 me in exchange for =reward_ gold pieces. One as
 cunning as yourself can see the balance is well
 in favor of a pact between us. Bring me what I want
 and earn the favor of the Lord of Death itself.

<ce> Will you give the research notes to the Necromancers?

Message:  1017
<ce> A smart choice, %ra. Have your money. I will
<ce> spread the word concerning your prudence and
<ce> values. I assure you, having the Necromancers
<ce> for friends is not to be regretted.
