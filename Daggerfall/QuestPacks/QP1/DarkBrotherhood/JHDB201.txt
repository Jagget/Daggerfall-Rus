QRC:

QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce> Understand that we have no personal vendetta
<ce> against this mark, %pct. For us, all are
<ce> free to obey the sky, the trees, the Night Mother, or
<ce> nothing at all, however they may find satisfaction.
<ce> Yet when one causes wild beasts to attack passers
<ce> by, a request for an accounting quickly follows.
<ce> Will you return a nature-crazed hermit to the earth?
   <--->
<ce> On rare occasions, we receive petitions to execute
<ce> the law when the town guard refuses to do so.
<ce> My reading of the law is rather negligent, but I
<ce> am certain some provision must exist against
<ce> enraging wild animals and sending them into
<ce> nearby towns. Are you willing to play executioner
<ce> against a nature-wielding hermit?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce> This contract will be taken up quickly.
<ce> It will be a true joy to someone.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce> The recluse has made of ___mondung_
<ce> a home, completing rituals of kinds that drive
<ce> the wildlife into a frenzy. Apparently these
<ce> attacks wane during the night hours, as even
<ce> the clerics of the dirt require rest. Restore
<ce> the natural order and return before =timer_
<ce> nights have passed. Mephala be with you.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce> You were to report to _questgiver_
<ce> concerning the wild hermit's death by now.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce> Now you see the dangers of subsisting entirely
<ce> on _alch_. The Brotherhood is pleased
<ce> to provide a return to the natural order when
<ce> all other responsible parties refuse to do so.

Message:  1020
<ce> The priest of nature is now dead. The wild
<ce> animals will likely return to their natural patterns.

Message:  1024
<ce> Odd. _questgiver_ warned you
<ce> your mark would cause mayhem with the
<ce> local wildlife, but this place shows no signs
<ce> of it. Perhaps the rumors were overblown.

Message:  1030
%qdt:
 In ___mondung_ there's a
 religious hermit who has caused
 animal attacks on surrounding cities.
 I must execute the Dark Brotherhood's
 contract to cull the priest and return
 to ___questgiver_ in =timer_ days' time.
