QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce> Occasionally we receive requests to claim a life
<ce> while deflecting suspicion. The greatest assassins
<ce> in all Tamriel know how to make people die quickly
<ce> or slowly, which is why our business recurs.
<ce> Will you accept a simple job to poison a mark?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce> Why? Do you need to drink blood after every kill?

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce> This task will send you to ___tavern_.
<ce> The target, _mark_, is expecting a
<ce> prepaid shipment of _plant_ within =2tavern_
<ce> days' time. You will deliver this in its place.
<ce> We have dispatched %g3 regular courier, so you will
<ce> face no interference. Avoid unshielded contact with
<ce> the plant. The poison we have placed on it will
<ce> react over several hours. To avoid suspicion, you
<ce> must not stay within the building for more than a
<ce> few minutes. Your face will be easily remembered
<ce> otherwise. Return when the task is finished. Farewell.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce> _mark_ expected the _plant_
<ce> to arrive in ___tavern_ by now.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce> I presume you did not linger in the tavern
<ce> for very long? It would be a shame for the Brotherhood
<ce> to be associated with clumsy traipsing by one of its
<ce> members, no matter %pg3 history. Your devotion
<ce> has been noted, %pct.

Message:  1015
<ce> The time you've spent in this tavern has given the
<ce> patrons time to commit you to memory. Your work has failed.

Message:  1020
<ce> Yes, courier? Why thank you! Yes, this will do just fine.
<ce> A lovely sample if I say so myself. Finest work. Send my
<ce> regards to my friends. It'll be some time before I can visit.

Message:  1021
<ce> Yes? What is this? Pardon me for saying this, but I do
<ce> not recognize or trust you. For all I know you could be
<ce> delivering this to the wrong person and soon I will
<ce> have some angry lout breaking my door down for
<ce> his _plant_. Is there some reason I should
<ce> accept this?
   <--->
<ce> Hello. I'm sorry, what? I don't recognize you.
<ce> I get my shipments from a certain courier in whom I
<ce> have placed my confidence, and that is not you.
<ce> Is there any reason I should accept this _plant_?

Message:  1022
<ce> My regular courier would have informed me if something had
<ce> changed. Surely if he sent you, you must know what our
<ce> arrangement is. Am I going to pay you for this delivery?
   <--->
<ce> I should be a fool to take this. But our friendship
<ce> is not worth tossing into the wastepit merely because
<ce> of a wrinkle in the delivery process. Tell me,
<ce> before I make my decision. The agreement that I have
<ce> to receive this, does it require that I pay my courier?

Message:  1023
<ce> Well said. I will admit that my suspicions get the worst
<ce> of me. This is just a sample of _plant_. What
<ce> could possibly go wrong? Thank you, friend.
<ce> I will take it now. Send my regards to the fellows
<ce> at the apothecary. I hope to see them soon.
   <--->
<ce> Indeed. I think it's been a long week and my
<ce> suspicions have run away with me this time.
<ce> I will take it. Thank you. After all, what harm
<ce> could come from this little sample of _plant_?
<ce> Farewell, friend. Safe travels.

Message:  1024
<ce> No, no, this will not do. Something is clearly wrong
<ce> here, and I will not make of myself a thief to
<ce> accept this odd shipment. Leave now.
   <--->
<ce> No, I refuse. This is all too odd. Leave now.
<ce> I will have nothing to do with this. If I am making
<ce> a mistake, I will sort it out later. Begone.
