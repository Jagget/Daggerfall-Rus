QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce> Idiocy in Tamriel seems to know no bounds.
<ce> Imagine the stupidity of a person who
<ce> enters a Dark Brotherhood sanctuary
<ce> unannounced and invited, and begins
<ce> taking valuable items from off the ground.
<ce> Such is the quality of people the Thieves Guild
<ce> is turning out these days. If you will slay this
<ce> thief, you'll be rewarded with an item
<ce> that will empower you to swim like
<ce> the swiftest of fish.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce> The Thieves Guild's members are pitifully weak.
<ce> This job will be a Sundas stroll for someone else.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce> I pray that the Thieves Guild will learn to keep
<ce> their members to stay out of our halls, and soon.
<ce> The fool recently left town, and now stays at
<ce> _tav_ of ___tav_. So says the Spymaster.
<ce> Return with news of the thief's death
<ce> within =timer_ days.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce> The Spymaster is not wrong, %pcf.
<ce> Find and kill the thief at _tav_ of ___tav_.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce> To be honest, I hoped you would accept this contract.
<ce> Our members are expected to put the Night Mother's wishes
<ce> above all other considerations. The Thieves Guild's
<ce> loss is your gain -- and your new _reward_ proves it.

Message:  1010
<ce> Somewhere in this tavern is the thief
<ce> you have to slay.

Message:  1011
<ce> "Oh yeah? I'm tougher than you!"

Message:  1012
<ce> The thief is dead.
