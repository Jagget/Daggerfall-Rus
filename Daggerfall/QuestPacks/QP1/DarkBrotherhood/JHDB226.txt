QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce> It seems the Fighters Guild of late has begun
<ce> accepting contracts to slay civilized people.
<ce> We have no qualms when they kill harpies and spriggans,
<ce> but murder is Mephala's domain, and we will remove interlopers.
<ce> Your reward for killing three Fighters Guild members
<ce> will be an object enchanted with the power of levitation.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce> You seem to love the Fighters Guild more
<ce> than the Brotherhood. This concerns me deeply.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce> The manner of execution doesn't matter, so long as
<ce> the fear of the Brotherhood runs deep afterward.
<ce> Find them in _res_, to the %di.
<ce> You have two days to count the tale of their murder.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce> All three are not dead, %pct.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce> Hmm. The city feels a little quieter with those barbarians dead.
<ce> Mephala enjoys silence, they say. As for you, take your _reward_,
<ce> which will let you soar like a hawk. May it aid you in
<ce> your service to the Night Mother.

Message:  1010
<ce> This is the right house. Now you need to find
<ce> the Fighters Guild members within.

Message:  1011
<ce> "Th-the Dark Brotherhood! Hey everyone!
<ce> Wake up! We got a fight on our hands!!"

Message:  1012
<ce> The Brotherhood's foes are dead.
