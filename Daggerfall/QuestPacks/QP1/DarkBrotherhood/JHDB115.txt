QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce> A small herd of so-called Brotherhood "hunters"
<ce> has taken up to hiding in a remote cave in
<ce> %crn. We need someone skilled to teleport
<ce> in to their den and wipe them all out.
<ce> Can you handle that?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce> Perhaps you're looking for one of those non-violent contracts.
<ce> That is, the ones that don't exist.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce> Excellent. Take this _gem_. Its enchantment
<ce> will send you into the depths. The place is warded
<ce> sufficiently to warn the group concerning any entrance
<ce> or exit except by this means. Therefore, once you're
<ce> in, don't think about leaving unless you desire to
<ce> report your failure. The gem will lose its power
<ce> in about 6 hours' time, which will allow you to
<ce> prepare. Bring me word of your success once
<ce> you are certain this vigilante band is no more.
<ce> May the Night Mother bless your work, %pct.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce> The gem's magical essence ebbs away.
<ce> You now have no means to find the band of manhunters.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce> Well done. The %t will have to think twice before
<ce> trying a ruse like this again. Fine work, %pcf.
   <--->
<ce> Comically enough, the %t laid this plan to
<ce> replace us with something more malleable.
<ce> Surely we will have more such bands to hunt in the future.

Message:  1010
<ce> Once you activate it, the _gem_'s magical power
<ce> swells up and begins churning powerfully.
<ce> A blinding light obliges you to close your eyes.

Message:  1011
<ce> The gem has shattered under the magical force. The band of
<ce> Brotherhood hunters will be somewhere in this pit.
<ce>
<ce> (Hint: You may be in a location that's impossible to escape from,)
<ce> (like the bottom of a chute. If so,)
<ce> (make a save and try the console command "teleport" to get out.)

Message:  1012
<ce> Your lying in wait has paid off.
<ce> The band has arrived, ready for a fight.

Message:  1013
<ce> This appears to be all of them.
<ce> Now to report to _qgiver_.

Message:  1014
<ce> Leaving ___dung_ has tripped the wards placed
<ce> by the hunting band. Any chance of finding them is now long gone.

Message:  1015
<ce> You become aware of a hulking, magical construct as it approaches.
<ce> Through heavy, metallic breathing, it states its intention.
<ce>
<ce> "Death to trespassers. Masters must survive."
<ce>
<ce> This band seems to have a defense system inside
<ce> ___dung_ to hunt down intruders.

%qdt:
 The Dark Brotherhood of ___qgiver_
 has given me a _gem_ which will send
 me to a pit, refuge to a group of
 headhunters working against our kind.
 I am not to leave the cave until
 they have been slain.
