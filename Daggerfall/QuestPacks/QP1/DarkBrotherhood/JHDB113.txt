QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce> One of our regular clients has a peculiar
<ce> desire to dispose of one of %crn's
<ce> more infamous scoundrels in a rather dramatic fashion.
<ce> We need someone to take a hostage to a remote
<ce> cave to be eaten alive. Are you capable of this?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce> Ah, you're trying to avoid the gruesome work. I see.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce> In ___res_ an aristocrat named _hos_
<ce> lives in _res_. Take %g2 from there to a
<ce> hole called ___dung_. Once inside,
<ce> ring this _bell_ and step back. The matter
<ce> will resolve itself in summary fashion.
<ce> I merely ask that you bring back some proof
<ce> of the fool's death to provide to our client.
<ce> Have this done in =timer_ days.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce> _qgiver_ asked you to finish
<ce> the feeding contract by now.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce> Rather efficient, isn't it %pct? It almost
<ce> makes me want to forget what it feels like
<ce> to push a blade into human flesh and dig inward
<ce> until the mark stops moving. Ah, the joys
<ce> of our work. The client specifically stipulated
<ce> that our agent be given a payment. Take this.

Message:  1010
<ce> _hos_ is unable to so much as speak a word
<ce> before you have ensured %g3 silence. You begin to
<ce> lead your semi-cooperative hostage out of the building.

Message:  1011
<ce> You ring the bell and step back, pushing _hos_
<ce> to the ground. With %g3 hands tied %g1 can only watch
<ce> the pair of tigers approach. The act of disposal takes
<ce> less than a minute. You are careful to snatch one of
<ce> the mark's fingers before the animals devour it.

Message:  1012
<ce> As luck would have it, the beasts' hunger is not sated.
<ce> Perhaps it's been some time since their masters have
<ce> brought a free meal. They appear to have no qualms
<ce> taking advantage of your visit.
