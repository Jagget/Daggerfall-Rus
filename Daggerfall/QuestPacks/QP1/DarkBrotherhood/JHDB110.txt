QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce> Does the name _kid_ ring a bell,
<ce> %pcf? It belongs to one of the more famous
<ce> ransom marks in %crn. We have word
<ce> of a plot being conducted by some ring of
<ce> amateurs, and wish to take possession of it.
<ce> Will you be Mephala's hand in stealing this child away?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce> A trifling matter. We have much to do.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce> We know _kid_ will be taken to ___place_
<ce> in =2place_ days. Look in _place_.
<ce> The captors intend to spend no more than
<ce> twenty-four hours in the building, so you must
<ce> not fail in arriving. Once you have completed the
<ce> transfer, take %g2 to _ransom_ at
<ce> ___ransom_. Now go.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce> You are too late. _kid_ will
<ce> have left ___place_ by now.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce> Once you enter the building, a member of
<ce> the Brotherhood stops you to speak.
<ce>
<ce> "Excellent work. We will carry the burden of this
<ce> child's welfare now. Come, _kid_.
<ce> We have much to do."
<ce>
<ce> _kid_ is led out of the building.
<ce> Your work is done.

%qdt:
 The Dark Brotherhood has sent
 me to interrupt another group's
 ransom plot. I will find _kid_ in
 _place_ of ___place_
 in =2place_ days and take
 %g2 to _ransom_,
 ___ransom_. The child will only
 be in ___place_ for a single day.
 I must not fail to arrive.
