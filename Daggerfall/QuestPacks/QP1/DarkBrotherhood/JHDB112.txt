QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce> Surprising as it may be, some of our more
<ce> weak-willed members have expressed discontent
<ce> with Mephala's rule and tried to organize
<ce> themselves as a rival assassination
<ce> guild. It's really more pathetic than
<ce> threatening, and I do not expect we
<ce> will need more than one person to flatten
<ce> it to the ground. I extend this opportunity
<ce> to you due to your loyalty.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce> So soon as our other associates know of this,
<ce> we will have swarms begging to take care of it.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce> The riffraff are operating out of ___res_.
<ce> They are far more skilled at fleeing than at
<ce> combat, which says much of why they have little
<ce> to do with us. In other words, you'll need to earn
<ce> their trust and lower their guard before you
<ce> make the killing blow. The Spymaster tells us
<ce> the very center of it all is _th_.
<ce> Find %g2 in _res_ and breach %g3
<ce> distrust. Strike when you see the proper moment.
<ce> Then return. You are granted =timer_ days.
<ce>
<ce> First, take this basilisk's eye. That's their sad
<ce> attempt at secrecy. _th_ will not
<ce> speak to anyone who will not show it first.
<ce> Second, this letter. It will open up
<ce> a discussion on a supposed accounting
<ce> that %g1 doesn't know actually failed.
<ce> Third, this _gem_. Once it leaves your hands
<ce> it will dissipate the magicka of the holder.
<ce> Such tricks as invisibility and teleportation will
<ce> remain out the question. The rest is up to you.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce> You were to report on _th_'s death by now.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce> Ah, well done. This is why the Dark Brotherhood
<ce> continues to be feared. I need not brag. Our actions
<ce> speak far louder than I ever could.

Message:  1010
<ce> _th_ stares at you with cold eyes.
<ce> Radiating fear and tension, %g1 says nothing at all.
<ce>
<ce> In all likelihood you could probably get a reward
<ce> from this group by alerting them to the Brotherhood's
<ce> plot. No one would know of the deal you strike.
<ce> Do you attempt to make a deal with %g2?

Message:  1011
<ce> Your mark relaxes a little upon seeing
<ce> the basilisk's eye.
<ce>
<ce> "I have never seen you before, which
<ce> is a poor omen. Who are you and
<ce> why have you sought me out?"

Message:  1012
<ce> _th_ tears the paper from your
<ce> hands and starts to read, never fully
<ce> taking %g3 attention from you. After
<ce> reading it twice through, %g1
<ce> starts to think.
<ce>
<ce> "Fine then. %pcf, I guess I have no reason
<ce> to doubt you. Where's the pay for this job?
<ce> This wasn't a simple murder."

Message:  1013
<ce> You offer the _gem_, which %g1 eyes greedily.
<ce> The instant it touches %g3 hand, %g3 eyes grow
<ce> wide. Magical power seems to waft away from %g2.
<ce> _th_ unsheathes %g3 weapon and shouts,
<ce> "What?! No! No, I'll kill you! Die, filthy pig!"

Message:  1014
<ce> Without %g3 leadership, _th_'s guild will dissolve.

Message:  1015
<ce> You show _th_ the basilisk's eye
<ce> and explain what the Dark Brotherhood has sent you
<ce> to do. At first %g1 is far too suspicious and
<ce> intends to escape, but you quickly show the letter
<ce> and payment that were meant to deceive %g2.
<ce>
<ce> "Can this be so? _qgiver_ has actually
<ce> found us? This cannot be. And who are you to trick
<ce> the Dark Brotherhood? What do you want?"
<ce>
<ce> You insinuate that a payment would probably be
<ce> appropriate for the service you've rendered.
<ce> Grumbling a little, %g1 nevertheless sees the
<ce> sense of paying you off. You accept =reward_ gold
<ce> pieces in a small pouch, and _th_
<ce> mutters a spell to disappear.

Message:  1020
<ce> _th_'s suspicions win %g2 over.
<ce> "I knew it!" %g1 shouts before casting a
<ce> spell, conveying %g2 out of the building entirely.
<ce> You have lost your opportunity.

Message:  1030
%qdt:
 _qgiver_ of the Dark Brotherhood,
 ___qgiver_, has offered me the privilege
 of stamping out a small rival organization.
 The leader, _th_, hides in
 ___res_ and needs to be deceived
 into trusting me before I can strike.
 I have a basilisk's eye to prove my loyalty,
 a letter detailing a current job, and a
 _gem_ that needs to get into %g3 hands.
 I have =timer_ days to kill %g2 and return.
