QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce> Mephala watch your blade, %pct.
<ce> Your loyalty to the Brotherhood exceeds
<ce> all other concerns. Prove it by disposing of a
<ce> member of the Fighters Guild who has taken up residence
<ce> in one of %crn's caverns.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce> Then find some other way to prove your loyalty.
<ce> But prove it, lest your time come as well.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce> You will travel to ___dung_ and find
<ce> the fighter inside. Use whatever method best suits you.
<ce> The more evident that this was the work of the Brotherhood,
<ce> the better for us all. Let none cross our reputation
<ce> with impunity. The fool will only stay there for =2res_ days,
<ce> so ensure the killing is done by then. Report your success
<ce> at any time after that.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce> The Fighters Guild mark has fled ___dung_ by now.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce> Some in this hall feared you had loyalties elsewhere.
<ce> I am happy to see the contrary. We don't
<ce> always compensate our contracts, but I happened to
<ce> get my hands on this _magic_ that can paralyze foes,
<ce> and I thought of you.
<ce> May Mephala's foes know true terror at your hands.

Message:  1021
<ce> I won't go down easy!
<ce> I'm a member of the Fighters Guild!
   <--->
<ce> Ha! I'll show you what the guild taught me!

Quest log:

Message:  1031
%qdt:
_questgiver_ assigned me
to slay a member of
the Fighters Guild in ___dung_
before =2res_ days have passed.
I can return to the Brotherhood
in ___questgiver_ at any time afterward.

Message:  1041
<ce> The Fighters Guild now has one less mercenary
