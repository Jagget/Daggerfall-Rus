QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce> We require the aid of one skilled in combat,
<ce> quick to think and act. One of our senior members
<ce> is conducting a ritual to obtain dark powers and
<ce> will soon awaken in weakness. Someone must provide
<ce> protection when that happens. Will you go?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce> Then get out of the way. This task needs fulfilling.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce> Somewhere in ___dung_, our friend
<ce> _dbf_ has taken refuge while performing
<ce> a lengthy ritual to become a lich. The Spymaster
<ce> hears rumors that a tribe of brutes will attack %g2
<ce> immediately concluding the transformation, while %g1
<ce> is weakest. Stay with _dbf_ until %g3 foes
<ce> are slain. I will have a magical _item_ for your reward.
<ce> Hurry there, for I doubt %g1 can delay longer than
<ce> =2dung_ days to finish the ritual.
<ce> Show %g2 this old _gem_ which belongs to %g2,
<ce> and return it to me with %g3 power in it.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce> _dbf_ has been slain.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce> Ah, the energized _gem_ of _dbf_.
<ce> Proof enough. We will have much to do with %g2 in
<ce> the future. Your loyalty to the Brotherhood has been noted.

Message:  1010
<ce> _dbf_ appears to be only barely conscious.
<ce> Great magical power emanates from %g3 body.
<ce>
<ce> Sensing the _gem_, %g1 seems to grow more
<ce> lucid. Now that you're here, the final step of the
<ce> ritual can begin.

Message:  1011
<ce> (ORCISH CHECK FAILED)
<ce>
<ce> You are brought up straight by Orcish shouting.
<ce> You do not know what they mean, but they
<ce> are obviously hostile. They march toward
<ce> the two of you.

Message:  1012
<ce> (ORCISH CHECK PASSED)
<ce>
<ce> You are brought up straight by Orcish shouting.
<ce> You know enough of their speech to understand.
<ce>
<ce> "Another lich in the land! Slay it!
<ce> Let the Bretons gain no more power!"
<ce>
<ce> They march toward the two of you.

Message:  1013
<ce> The ritual finishes, and _dbf_ cackles.
<ce>
<ce> "Finally, undying power is mine! Let these orcs
<ce> be the first witnesses of my wrath!"
<ce>
<ce> Then %g1 beckons you to continue the fight.

Message:  1014
<ce> _dbf_'s ritual is finished by now, and
<ce> you were not there to protect %g2.

Message:  1015
<ce> The orcs are dead. _dbf_ grins delightfully.
<ce>
<ce> "Well done, %ra. May we meet again in darkness."
<ce>
<ce> You explain that you need evidence of your deed,
<ce> and %g1 casts a spell on the Lodestone, making it glow.
<ce> With that, %g1 leaves you.
