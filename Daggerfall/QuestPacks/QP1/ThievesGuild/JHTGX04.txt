<ce> The Crow definitely wouldn't have
<ce> wanted you to take this much time.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce> The Crow saunters in pleasantly.
<ce>
<ce> "Well, nice work, my friend. I'm not
<ce> going to spare a lot for this job since
<ce> I'm splitting my pay three ways, but
<ce> the next one's gonna be worth a lot more,
<ce> I promise. Hopefully this teaches
<ce> the Fighters Guild not to come after
<ce> us anymore, right kid?"
<ce>
<ce> He hands you a sack of coins.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
They say The Crow's showing up in the Bay again. I think it's an impostor.
   <--->
Y'hear about The Crow showing up in some town? Probably lies.
   <--->
They say The Crow's around, but I thought he died awhile ago.

RumorsPostSuccess:  [1007]

<ce> I've got a change of pace for you here.
<ce> I'm about to head over to _tavern_
<ce> here in town. The job's already done and I'm
<ce> gonna go pick up the parts myself. Problem is,
<ce> someone's tipped off a bunch of Fighters Guild
<ce> wimps and they're all headed in there like they
<ce> own the place. Dunno who pays them to go back
<ce> for a dead body. Anyway, first check the body,
<ce> and then stay and make sure no one touches it.
<ce> Kill everyone who goes in there. I'll be there after
<ce> the fracas is over. Don't waste time.

 "The Crow" told me to get to
 _tavern_ here in ___tavern_
 and stave off a bunch of Fighters
 Guild people who are coming to take
 away one of his merchandise bodies.
 He told me to get there as soon as
 I can. Once I check the body myself
 I should stand watch near it until
 he shows up.

Message:  1070
<ce> This looks like the body. You
<ce> move it out of the way, and it only
<ce> takes a few seconds for heavy
<ce> footsteps to come plodding around.

Message:  1080
<ce> Do you wish to leave behind the _lode_
<ce> and give up your ties to The Crow?

Message:  1081
<ce> You discard the small piece of metal.
<ce> Whatever schemes he has are his alone now.

Message:  1082
<ce> You return the _lode_ to your
<ce> belongings, at least for now.
