<ce> Oh yeah, this is exactly what we're looking for.
<ce> Not bad at all. Your next one's gonna pay even more,
<ce> trust me. Let's keep this going.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
They say The Crow's showing up in the Bay again. I think it's an impostor.
   <--->
Y'hear about The Crow showing up in some town? Probably lies.
   <--->
They say The Crow's around, but I thought he died awhile ago.

If the Fighters Guild ever gets its hands on that %ra, they are gonna tear %pg2 apart.

<ce> "I'm gonna give you a little background this time.
<ce> Figure you've proven your worth and you're already
<ce> knee-deep in this anyway. If I can read your mind
<ce> for a minute, no, I'm not a cannibal, and no, the
<ce> money I'm paying you with isn't mine. I'm paid
<ce> just like you by our good employers. They're running
<ce> a series of businesses over in the Imperial Province.
<ce> Some place called Bruna or Brunner or something.
<ce> I can never remember since I've never gone. I don't
<ce> ask them what the parts are for and they don't tell
<ce> me. What I do know is that they pay like the %t.
<ce> Some people would look down on what we're doing and
<ce> I guess that's their point of view, but to me we're
<ce> supplying a legitimate demand for needy customers.
<ce> And if we don't do it, someone else will.
<ce>
<ce> "And that's that. One thing they told me is that they
<ce> prefer 'well-exercised' bodies. I've sent them
<ce> samples from mages, from knights, from thieves,
<ce> and they keep telling me the best ones are from
<ce> the Fighters Guild. Dunno why."

Message:  1011
<ce> "So your next job is simple. You'll be doing the killing
<ce> and the looting. There's another of those Fighters Guild
<ce> morons living over in ___res_, in a house
<ce> called _res_. Find the creep at
<ce> night so you don't attract as much attention. This
<ce> time you'll be bringing me the lungs and the brain.
<ce> Take this bag and do the normal thing. If I have to
<ce> explain it at this point, you're fired. Come see me
<ce> at _crowhome_ in ___crowhome_
<ce> when you're done. This one pays =reward_ gold."
<ce>
<ce> The Crow waves you off and walks out.

 My next target for The Crow
 is in _res_
 at ___res_, a
 member of the Fighters Guild.
 I should approach at night.
 The Crow will pay me
 in _crowhome_
 at ___crowhome_ afterward.

Message:  1060
<ce> Your entry was not unnoticed. Soon your
<ce> target begins shuffling toward you.

Message:  1070
<ce> If the killing is this fresh, hopefully the
<ce> people in the Imperial Province will send
<ce> more money down the road. Now you need
<ce> to use the bag to gather the materials.

Message:  1071
<ce> You gather up the lungs and brain and seal the bag.

Message:  1080
<ce> Do you wish to leave behind the _lode_
<ce> and give up your ties to _crow_?

Message:  1081
<ce> You discard the small piece of metal.
<ce> Whatever schemes he has are his alone now.

Message:  1082
<ce> You return the _lode_ to your
<ce> belongings, at least for now.
