<ce> Well, what do you know. I know you. You're
<ce> %pcn. You decided to come.
<ce> How about that? I'm quite thrilled. Welcome.
<ce> I'd offer you some tea if I had any. A shame
<ce> I don't. What I do have is =reward_ gold pieces
<ce> instead. I hope that'll make up the difference.
<ce> Why don't I just hand this to you and we can
<ce> sit down to talk? I'm a man of my word, after all.

%pcn the %ra,
 
  Finest salutations to a fine thief.
  I am a man in need of very good
  talent: a burglar and a blackguard
  put together. Why don't you swing
  by so we can discuss my offer
  under more pleasant terms?
  Look for me in ___res_.
  I'll be at _res_.
  You'll get =reward_ gold pieces just
  for making the trip, no commitment
  necessary. See you soon.
 
          K.

<ce> Well, if you don't mind my getting down to
<ce> brass tacks, why don't we have a little talk?
<ce> I'm something of a member of the Thieves Guild
<ce> myself. That's how I know about you.
<ce> Spymaster's awfully useful sometimes. I look
<ce> for folks who have a strong stomach and the
<ce> ability to follow orders and defend themselves.
<ce> In return, my employers pay out several thousands
<ce> of gold per job. That's quite a bit better
<ce> than what they're offering over at the guild,
<ce> don't you think? And don't worry, this isn't
<ce> a competing interest. I promise you your
<ce> reputation with the Thieves Guild will
<ce> be immaculate if you take me up on this.
<ce> Want in on this neat opportunity?

Message:  1012
<ce> Now that's a good answer. You've put a
<ce> smile on this face, %pcf. I'm putting
<ce> my good name on the line for you, and
<ce> I know you won't let me down. This'll
<ce> be a very mutually beneficial arrangement.
<ce> Oh, my name. I didn't even tell you.
<ce> I am known as "The Crow," but I send
<ce> letters as "K." It's simpler that way.
<ce> I'm known as one of the oldest and most
<ce> skilled thieves in the entire Iliac Bay.
<ce> Age leads a man to teach others to do
<ce> his work for him and share in the profits,
<ce> you see? That's why I'm not hoarding all
<ce> this gold for myself.
<ce>
<ce> Now, to see whether you're sincere, I'm going
<ce> to have to prove whether you can handle it.

Message:  1030
%qdt:
 Someone named "K." has sent
 me a letter offering me =reward_ gold
 pieces if I just listen to a job offer.
 I can find him at _res_,
 in ___res_ in ____res_.

Message:  1080
<ce> Will you instead slay _crow_?

Message:  1081
<ce> The old man titters as you ready for combat.
<ce>
<ce> "Oh, my, what a fool I've made of myself.
<ce> How do I find such hotheads? I'll
<ce> have to let our mutual friends
<ce> over at the Thieves Guild know about
<ce> this uncomfortable little encounter."
<ce>
<ce> He pulls a cloak over his head
<ce> which renders him completely invisible.
<ce> Your attempts to touch him are futile.
<ce> Within seconds you hear the door open and close.

Message:  1082
<ce> "How kind of you. Thank you for
<ce> turning me down in person. I'll
<ce> move down the list then."
<ce>
<ce> _crow_ pulls a cloak over
<ce> his head as he smiles pleasantly.
<ce> Some enchantment on the garment
<ce> renders him completely invisible.
<ce> The door opens and closes, and
<ce> he is suddenly gone.
