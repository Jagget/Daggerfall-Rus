<ce> I've got one final irregular job before we can
<ce> start up a rhythm. If you're constant, I can get
<ce> a stream of jobs coming in. You'll be able to make
<ce> as much money as you want.

<ce> I tried looking around, and there's three members of the
<ce> Fighters Guild who waste their time in ___weap_.
<ce> Look for someone named _fg_. If you're
<ce> lucky at all, you'll find all three together and get
<ce> it done. Get all three tongues and a kidney.
<ce> I'll be paying =reward_ this time. Meet me
<ce> in ___crowhome_, at _crowhome_.
