<ce> What is this? You fool! You moron!
<ce> Incompetent halfwit! What did I say?
<ce> Do not, do not ever, open the bag!
<ce> What's wrong with you?!
<ce> Get out of my sight! Now!

<ce> I told you it'd be simple, didn't I?
<ce> Here's your money. I always do what
<ce> I say. You'll see. But take the
<ce> money and we'll keep talking.

They say The Crow's showing up in the Bay again. I think it's an impostor.
   <--->
Y'hear about The Crow showing up in some town? Probably lies.
   <--->
They say The Crow's around, but I thought he died awhile ago.

<ce> First of all, I'm giving you a _lode_.
<ce> It'll let me find you in case things go awry.
<ce> We both know anything can happen in this business.
<ce> If you ever lose it somewhere I won't be able
<ce> to track you any more, so unless you're gonna
<ce> give up on me, keep it safe.
<ce>
<ce> So here's your test. One of my former friends
<ce> wimped out on the job you're going to do.
<ce> Long story short, there's a bag of merchandise
<ce> waiting for pick-up. Just go on over to
<ce> _apoc_ in ___apoc_.
<ce> You'll see the bag there. Don't open it,
<ce> no matter how eager you are. It's going to
<ce> be properly treated so as long as it doesn't
<ce> touch the open air, it'll stay good for months.
<ce> I'm gonna stay in ___res_.
<ce> Look for me in _res_.
<ce> For this one I'm paying =reward_ gold.
<ce> Couldn't ask for anything easier, right?
<ce> Now go get it, champ.

 "The Crow," a supposedly legendary
 thief, has recruited me in some
 scheme for his employers.
 He wants me to get a bag of
 merchandise from _apoc_
 at ___apoc_ and take
 it to his meeting spot,
 _res_ of ___res_.

Message:  1070
<ce> This is the bag _crow_ told you
<ce> about. Do you wish to open it?

Message:  1071
<ce> You open the bag. The preserving agents
<ce> begin to expire due to their contact
<ce> with the open air, and you are greeted
<ce> with the sight and smell of various
<ce> internal organs.

Message:  1072
<ce> You keep the bag sealed and
<ce> add it to your belongings.
<ce> The little you can sense from it
<ce> is that something moist is inside.
<ce> Multiple layers of fabric prevent
<ce> anything from spilling out.

Message:  1080
<ce> Do you wish to leave behind the _lode_
<ce> and give up your ties to _crow_?

Message:  1081
<ce> You discard the small piece of metal.
<ce> Whatever schemes he has are his alone now.

Message:  1082
<ce> You return the _lode_ to your
<ce> belongings, at least for now.
