QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce> Got a simple bounty here for one zombie in a house.
<ce> Just gotta slay it and come for your payment,
<ce> and you'll have a little help too. Can you handle that?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce> Zombies are right pests, I agree.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce> Take this talisman. If at any point in the fight you feel
<ce> like it's about to take you, wrap your hands around this
<ce> trinket and press it tight. The zombie should freeze
<ce> up and let you get ready for more battle.
<ce> It'll still fight back, but you should get some breathing
<ce> room from it. Problem is, a talisman only works once before
<ce> it needs recharging. Come back when the thing's dead and we'll
<ce> get you a payment, all right? It's in _house_
<ce> here in town. I want to see you here in 24 hours.
<ce> Fight careful now.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce> Your twenty-four hours to report on
<ce> the zombie's death have expired.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce> Well done! Those things scare most people to death.
<ce> You've got a future with us, I think. Let me take back
<ce> that talisman, and here's your gold.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
Someone hatched a harpy around ___house_, but no one can find it.

QuestorPostSuccess:  [1008]
Now that you've slain that zombie, you're officially ready for the big stuff. What can I get you?

QuestorPostFailure:  [1009]
Hey, don't feel too bad about that zombie. Tough sons of Oblivion, they are.

%qdt:
 A zombie has invaded _house_
 in ___house_, and I need to kill
 it and return within 24 hours. I've been
 given a talisman which can stop it from moving,
 in case the battle gets too tough.

Message:  1011
<ce> The zombie is dead, and you are alive.
<ce> Time to return to the Fighters Guild.
