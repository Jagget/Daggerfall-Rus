QuestComplete:   [1004]
<ce> You reach in and find a decrepit pouch of gold
<ce> within the hole. It looks years old, and carries
<ce> no name. You ensure no one nearby cares as you
<ce> take it for yourself.

Message:  1010
<ce> You see a small hole in the ground here,
<ce> distinct from the nearby terrain.
<ce> It looks like it goes fairly deep.
<ce> Do you try to reach in and see if
<ce> anything is inside?

Message:  1011
<ce> You reach in and are surprised by the feel
<ce> of something furry within. You retract your
<ce> hand but have already disturbed the
<ce> denizen. An angry bat flies out to
<ce> attack you in self-defense.

Message:  1012
<ce> You reach in and find nothing at all.
<ce> Perhaps this is the den of some creature,
<ce> but it isn't home. You move on.

Message:  1013
<ce> Some holes simply don't need to be explored.
<ce> You leave this one alone.
