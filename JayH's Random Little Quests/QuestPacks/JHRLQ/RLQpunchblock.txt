<ce> When your turn comes, you stand before the peddler
<ce> and ready your stance. You summon up all your confidence
<ce> and throw your hand forward, shattering the steel block
<ce> into pieces. The crowd roars with approval, and the
<ce> showman offers you the somewhat paltry reward.

<ce> A sly-looking huckster displays a brick
<ce> and calls out at passers by, apparently
<ce> in the middle of a multi-stage attraction.
<ce>
<ce> "Ho there! I have here a slab
<ce> of solid steel, impervious to weaponry!
<ce> But I'm convinced that someone here
<ce> is capable of punching right through it!
<ce> You there! Or you! Which of you wants
<ce> to give it a try?"
<ce>
<ce> He proffers a small bag of gold for the
<ce> one who can break the block. Will you try?

<ce> You could make quite a spectacle of yourself

<ce> When your turn comes, you stand before the peddler
<ce> and ready your stance. You summon up all your confidence
<ce> and throw your hand forward, earning a loud cracking sound
<ce> and a deep, reverberating pain. Various reactions of
<ce> amusement and pity run through the spectators
<ce> as you shamefully withdraw, your pride wounded even
<ce> more than your hand.
