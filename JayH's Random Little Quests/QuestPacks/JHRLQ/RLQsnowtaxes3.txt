<ce> A small troop of the city watch trudges around
<ce> miserably in the snow, confronting the peasants
<ce> that pass by. They make their way to you.
<ce> 
<ce> "Hail, %ra. We come to collect taxes to fund
<ce> the city watch from all who benefit from
<ce> our protection. The decreed amount is 
<ce> 40 gold pieces. Are you able to pay now?"

Message:  1011
<ce> You take out 40 gold pieces and pay the
<ce> watchman. He smiles and takes
<ce> down your name and description.
<ce> 
<ce> "Thank you. %cn depends on this money
<ce> for its safety, and you are doing your
<ce> part. %god watch over us all."

Message:  1012
<ce> You start searching for 40 gold pieces, but
<ce> cannot find them on hand.

Message:  1013
<ce> The guard frowns and takes down a rough
<ce> description of you.
<ce> 
<ce> "Well, you can still turn in the money to
<ce> _person_ at _palace_ here in town within
<ce> the next 24 hours. Otherwise we'll remember
<ce> this. Fair %sea to you, %ra."

Message:  1014
