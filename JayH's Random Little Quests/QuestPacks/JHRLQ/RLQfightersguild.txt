<ce> "Then let me present you with this weapon.
<ce> Your kind do incalculable good here in
<ce> %crn. You would fare better with it than I.
<ce> Farewell."
<ce>
<ce> The hooded figure bows and departs.

Message:  1010
<ce> "Hold it!"
<ce>
<ce> A shrill voice calls out to you. You turn around and see
<ce> an hooded figure staring at you.
<ce>
<ce> "You, %ra! Are you one of those Fighters Guild people?"

Message:  1011
<ce> "Worthless pieces of garbage! I was evicted from my
<ce> home because you couldn't even clean out the bats!
<ce> Take this!"
<ce>
<ce> Whatever happened, you are now the target of
<ce> this person's rage.
<--->
<ce> "Ha, great! Another one down on the way home, what luck!"
<ce>
<ce> The assassin pulls out a knife and prepares for battle.
<--->
<ce> "Filthy money-lovers! Prepare to die!"
<ce>
<ce> The hooded figure unsheathes a blade.

Message:  1012
<ce> "I just wanted to thank you for getting that harpy
<ce> out of _place_. Terrifying event, that was.
<ce> You people are admirable. Safe journeys,
<ce> may %god be with you."
<ce>
<ce> She leaves you alone. Whoever killed that harpy
<ce> is earning quite a reputation.
<--->
<ce> "Finally! I never got to thank you for killing those
<ce> rats in _place_. I can't believe the town guard
<ce> leaves us to fend them off. You people are
<ce> a wonderful alternative."
<ce>
<ce> You're not sure this has anything to do with you,
<ce> but you accept the thanks on the Fighters Guild's
<ce> behalf and continue on.

Message:  1013
<ce> "Ah, appearances deceive. Very well, off I go."
<ce>
<ce> The hooded figure then departs.
<--->
<ce> "Are you sure? Could've sworn I heard about you
<ce> in the guild hall recently."
<ce>
<ce> Though perplexed, the figure heads off.
