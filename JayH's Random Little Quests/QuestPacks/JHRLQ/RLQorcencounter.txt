QuestComplete:   [1004]
<ce> The people nearby roar victoriously as the orc falls.
<ce> No one appears interested in taking his possessions.

Message:  1010
<ce> You notice a curious sight nearby. An orc, bundled up in human
<ce> clothing, is attempting to go about the town as an ordinary person.
<ce> He doesn't appear to be doing any harm as yet, but you don't
<ce> know his intentions. Do you call out for help (yes),
<ce> attack him yourself (no), or leave him alone (cancel)?

Message:  1011
<ce> The orc, spooked by your advance, runs away and manages to
<ce> escape. Hopefully he learned his lesson, anyway.

Message:  1012
<ce> Your shouting attracts the attention of two other
<ce> adventurers nearby. They ready arms.
<ce>
<ce> "No Orcs allowed! Strike him down!"
<ce>
<ce> The orc disposes of the disguise and readies a weapon.

Message:  1013
<ce> This is no concern of yours. If this orc really
<ce> is a threat, the city watch will take care of him.
