<ce> When it's your turn, your voice captivates the audience.
<ce> They all pause and seem to freeze in time,
<ce> held in suspense as you glide from one note to another.
<ce> Your performance feels all too short, for once it's over,
<ce> they throw coins at your feet with loud yells of appreciation.
<ce> Some cheering ensues before the next singer begins,
<ce> and you slip out of the crowd after gathering your gains.

Message:  1010
<ce> Some of the peasantry here in ___town_
<ce> have organized a singing circle, attempting to gain some
<ce> merriment for a day. Anyone who feels so inclined can
<ce> enter the circle and sing a chosen song.
<ce> While their standards don't seem exceptionally high,
<ce> no one has met them yet.
<ce> Do you attempt to join the circle?

Message:  1011
<ce> Merriment and singing are all well and good,
<ce> but you have other things to be doing.

<ce> 
<ce> You take your place on the edge of the crowd
<ce> and prepare to sing. You try your best, but
<ce> the crowd is not impressed. Some fair-minded
<ce> folks block the various objects hurled at you
<ce> in displeasure, and soon you take the hint and leave.
