<ce> Hoping no one spies you through the fog,
<ce> you quickly reach down and grab the bag.

Message:  1010
<ce> In your path, a small sack of gold lies on the ground.
<ce> You see no name on it, nor does anyone around seem
<ce> to be guarding it. It's too conspicuous to be
<ce> abandoned; surely it belongs to someone nearby, but
<ce> they have been momentarily careless.
<ce> 
<ce> Do you attempt to take it for yourself?

Message:  1011
<ce> This is no business for you. You ignore it.

Message:  1012
<ce> An angry shout from the nearby owner
<ce> brings you up straight.
<ce> The guards are already on their way;
<ce> not even returning the bag would
<ce> get you out of this.
<ce> You'll need some way to escape.

Message:  1013
<ce> You've hidden it away before anyone can notice.
