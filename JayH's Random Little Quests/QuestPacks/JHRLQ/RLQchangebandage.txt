QuestComplete:   [1004]
<ce> You begin systematically unravelling the bandages
<ce> on his legs. You're experienced enough to require no
<ce> help, and though it takes a few hours, it's a pleasant
<ce> experience for you both. The man cheerfully hands
<ce> you the payment, happy to have found an adequate physician.

Message:  1010
<ce> A heavily wounded peasant approaches you, needing help
<ce> to replace the bandages on his legs. He explains that
<ce> a recent forestry expedition went terribly wrong,
<ce> and he has to change the bandages each day.
<ce> If you have a proper understanding of medicine,
<ce> will you help him change them today for =reward_ gold?

Message:  1011
<ce> You can't possibly imagine everything that could go
<ce> wrong with this. You decline, garnering little surprise
<ce> from the wounded peasant.

Message:  1012
<ce> You hold the clean bandages and begin to unwrap the ones
<ce> already placed. Extreme discomfort follows for both of you,
<ce> as you awkwardly pull on the skin from angles you're not aware
<ce> of. A few minutes pass by before it becomes evident you
<ce> are no physician. The peasant interrupts you and flees
<ce> before suffering further at your hands. You wonder whether
<ce> you've exposed yourself to the risk of infectious disease
<ce> with this adventure.
