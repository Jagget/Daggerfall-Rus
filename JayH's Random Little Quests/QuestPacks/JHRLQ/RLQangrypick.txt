Message:  1012
<ce> Thankfully, you're also skilled with speech.
<ce> You deflect the accusations and match
<ce> every word. Your pursuer is dumbfounded
<ce> and decides to leave you alone.

Message:  1013
<ce> At least the guards aren't coming for you.
<ce> Your self-defense is probably justified here.
