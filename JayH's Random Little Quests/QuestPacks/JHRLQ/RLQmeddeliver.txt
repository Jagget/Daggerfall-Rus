<ce> Under the overcast sky, a woman in fairly
<ce> formal clothing accosts you,

<ce>
<ce> "EXCUSE ME! I need a delivery! _person_
<ce> at _tavern_ is expecting this _ingred_ and
<ce> will pay if you deliver it to %g2!
<ce> I don't have the time to do it myself!
<ce> Make some money today, why don't you?!"

Message:  1011

<ce> go get it at _tavern_ over to the %di!
<ce> Take the _ingred_, go find %g2!"

<ce> A tag on the _ingred_ says it needs to be
<ce> delivered within 24 hours.
