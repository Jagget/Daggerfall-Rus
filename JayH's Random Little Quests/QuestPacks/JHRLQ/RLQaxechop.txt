QuestComplete:   [1004]
<ce> You are led a short ways to the home
<ce> of this simple peasant. The
<ce> lumber poses no great difficulty
<ce> to someone of your strength.
<ce> It takes a few hours, but you manage to
<ce> fill an entire wagon with chopped wood,
<ce> enough to last several weeks.
<ce>
<ce> "You're awfully kind to do this for me.
<ce> I'm sure this gold won't compensate you.
<ce> Maybe %god will in my place.
<ce> May %monn be kind to you."

<ce> A weary, elderly peasant opportunes
<ce> people in the area for help with something.
<ce> He then approaches you, and asks for your
<ce> help in a raspy voice.
<ce>
<ce> "I'm sorry to bother you %ra, but I've no
<ce> one else to ask. I sent my children off to
<ce> labor for the season, and have run out of wood
<ce> for my stove at home. The nights get so cold.
<ce> I'm too old to chop the wood myself.
<ce> If you've got a strong arm and a few hours,
<ce> would you be able to chop some for me?
<ce> I'll pay you, honest."

<ce> "I'm sorry to bother you %ra, but I've no
<ce> one else to ask. My husband died this year
<ce> and my family has forgotten all about me.
<ce> All I want is some wood for the stove.
<ce> I get so cold at night I can't sleep, and
<ce> I can't split the wood myself.
<ce> If you've got a strong arm and a few hours,
<ce> would you be able to chop some for me?
<ce> I'll pay you what little money I can for it."

Message:  1011
<ce> The peasant's voice trembles.
<ce>
<ce> "Oh... Oh, I'm sure I'll find someone,
<ce> don't you worry. %god bless your travels."

Message:  1012
<ce> You take the hand axe and follow a short ways
<ce> to the peasant's home. You try and try to split
<ce> the wood, but you simply aren't strong enough
<ce> for the task. The elderly peasant, feeling sorry for
<ce> you, excuses you and thanks you for the attempt.
