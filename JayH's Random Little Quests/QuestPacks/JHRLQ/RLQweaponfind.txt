<ce> You take the weapon for yourself.

Message:  1010
<ce> The shining sun reflects off something partially
<ce> concealed in the ground. You make out the form of
<ce> a weapon, apparently an abandoned _weapon_.
<ce> Perhaps it has no owner now.
<ce> Will you take it for yourself?

Message:  1011
<ce> You start to unearth the weapon when you
<ce> hear a voice shout nearby. "Hey!
<ce> Filthy git, that's mine! Don't touch it!"
<ce> 
<ce> If you leave it now, you might be able
<ce> to avoid a misunderstanding. Of course,
<ce> you could still take the _weapon_
<ce> if you really wanted to.
<ce> Do you take the weapon anyway?

Message:  1012
<ce> "Hey! No, that's mine! Guards! Someone help!"
<ce> 
<ce> Commotion stirs nearby as the peasant
<ce> calls for the city watch.

Message:  1013
<ce> "That's right, you get back now!"
<ce> 
<ce> You back off and let the situation
<ce> alone. You could get into a lot of
<ce> trouble for persisting.

Message:  1014
<ce> For all you know, this is a trap of some kind
<ce> to hurt or defame a person. Better to let things be.

Message:  1015
<ce> You look around and try to make your intentions obvious,
<ce> just in case the _weapon_ actually belongs to someone
<ce> around here. No one stops you, and several townspeople
<ce> pass by without batting an eye.
