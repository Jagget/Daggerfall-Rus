Message:  1010
<ce> Screams nearby alert you to trouble.
<ce> A giant has lumbered into town, hungry from the
<ce> scarcity of winter and unwilling to listen
<ce> to reason. It has come for food -- animal or human.
<ce> Do you attempt to stop it?

Message:  1011
<ce> With the loudest shout you can muster,
<ce> you gain the giant's attention.
<ce> The townspeople stand back to watch your duel
<ce> with the creature.

Message:  1012
<ce> The townspeople roar with delight as the monster falls.
<ce> They leave you to take its belongings for your prize.

Message:  1013
<ce> You turn away and listen as the town guard surround
<ce> the creature, hacking it to bits. They soon share
<ce> the giant's belongings among one another as reward.
