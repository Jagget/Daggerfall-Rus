<ce> You may not be Tamriel's foremost expert on blocked
<ce> airways, but you know enough medicine to work out
<ce> a solution. You grab the child from his mother and
<ce> inspect his mouth, trying to dislodge anything
<ce> that may be readily visible. You then press
<ce> hard on the abdomen, expulsing the air that was
<ce> inside his lungs. A small, heavily gnawed object flies
<ce> out of his mouth and through the air. The boy's normal
<ce> breathing resumes, much to the relief of everyone present.
<ce> The mother sheepishly admits she doesn't have much
<ce> of a compensation to offer, but then pulls a book
<ce> out of her pack to pay you.

Message:  1010
<ce> A woman cries out in a shrill tone, begging for help.
<ce> Her young child is choking and she doesn't understand
<ce> how to help. They need a physician. Will you try?

Message:  1011
<ce> You refuse to intervene. Thankfully, it doesn't take
<ce> long for someone qualified to step up and resolve
<ce> the problem, earning the mother's profuse thanks.
<--->
<ce> You refuse to intervene. She calls out again and again,
<ce> and then passes by in a flurry. You see the boy's face
<ce> turning blue before they disappear from sight.

Message:  1012
<ce> You confidently step forward and grab the boy, and
<ce> then begin beating his back and neck to try to dislodge
<ce> whatever is stuck within. The mother watches in horror and
<ce> grabs him back after a few moments. The last you see of them,
<ce> the blue-faced child is dragged out into the rain,
<ce> hopefully to find someone qualified.
<ce>
<ce> An onlooker glares at you and shouts,
<ce> "If you're not qualified, don't waste the lady's time!
<ce> %oth!"
