<ce> To garner some kind of entertainment, the peasantry
<ce> are organizing random matches among fighters
<ce> using wooden rapiers. They don't look particularly
<ce> expert at the craft, though a random few seem to know
<ce> what they're doing. The entry fee is 50 gold,
<ce> and you would earn 100 if you won a round. Do you enroll?

Message:  1011
<ce> You move on and let the peasants have their games.
