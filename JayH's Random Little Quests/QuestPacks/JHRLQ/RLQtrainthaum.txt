<ce> You take a seat with the other students.
<ce> As promised, you hear a great deal about the
<ce> applications of thaumaturgy through a lengthy discourse.
<ce> Though some others are disappointed that they
<ce> failed to learn how to control the weather today,
<ce> you gained enough to make your payment worth it.
<ce> You look forward to practicing more thaumaturgy on your own time.

Message:  1010
<ce> An enterprising spellcaster takes advantage
<ce> of the rainy weather to advertise a small class
<ce> on the benefits of using the Water Walking spell to
<ce> move through the rain. If you stay for the three-hour
<ce> class, you'll need to pay 150 gold pieces, but you can
<ce> tell you'd learn quite a bit about thaumaturgy.
<ce> Pay for entry into the class?

Message:  1011
<ce> You let others join the class, preferring some place
<ce> without rain to drench you for the time being.

Message:  1012
<ce> You search for 150 gold pieces but don't find them.
<ce> The class soon starts without you.
