<ce> After feeding in 250 gold pieces, you sit down
<ce> and survey the contents of the book.
<ce> It has useful suggestions for pronunciation in the
<ce> Orcish language, and some tables for grammar.
<ce> Your three hours are well spent, at the end of which
<ce> the book disappears entirely, along with the pouch.

Message:  1010
<ce> You notice a book chained to a nearby wall,
<ce> replete with magical seals. Next to it hangs
<ce> a pouch with a note.
<ce>
<ce> "Bilingual dictionary. Target language: Orcish.
<ce> Book will open upon placing 250 gold coins within the pouch.
<ce> Three hours' availability at a time".
<ce>
<ce> The pouch is just barely open enough to fit
<ce> coins into its mouth. Do you take advantage
<ce> of the opportunity?

Message:  1011
<ce> You continue on without trying it. After a few
<ce> moments you look back by chance and notice that
<ce> the book and pouch are no longer visible.

Message:  1012
<ce> You search and search but cannot find 250 gold
<ce> coins among your things. You'll have to forego
<ce> the lesson this time. After a few
<ce> moments you look back by chance and notice that
<ce> the book and pouch are no longer visible.
