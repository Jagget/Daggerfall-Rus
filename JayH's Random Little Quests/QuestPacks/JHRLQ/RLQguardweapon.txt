<ce> You make sure no one is looking, and nab the axe.
<ce> Its restraint is flimsy and easily broken.
<ce> Since it's of generic make,
<ce> selling it should be quite easy.

Message:  1010
<ce> Fastened to a nearby wall, you see an axe with
<ce> a warning note written on the top:
<ce>
<ce> "PROPERTY OF THE CITY GUARD. DO NOT REMOVE"
<ce>
<ce> While it looks like an ordinary war axe, you could
<ce> still take it if you felt skilled in pickpocketing.
<ce> You don't think anyone's watching right now,
<ce> and the foggy air provides a natural cover.
<ce> Do you make the attempt?

Message:  1011
<ce> You feel no need to incite the wrath of the city watch.
<ce> You ignore the axe.

Message:  1012
<ce> You lay your hands on the axe and try to pull.
<ce> Your pickpocketing skills come up short, as
<ce> your obvious movements attract attention.
<ce> Members of the city watch hurtle towards you,
<ce> demanding that you halt.
