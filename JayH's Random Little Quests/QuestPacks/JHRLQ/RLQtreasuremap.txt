QuestFail:   [1003]
<ce> The treasure in ___dung_
<ce> will have been claimed by pirates by now.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce> This appears to be the fabled treasure.

Message:  1010
<ce> A piece of parchment is stuck in the snow here.
<ce> It seems a bit old and worn, and no one nearby
<ce> pays it any mind. It appears to have directions
<ce> to a cavern somewhere in %crn with a treasure inside.
<ce> Do you pick it up and read the directions?

Message:  1011
<ce> You are already busy enough without
<ce> investigating claims of treasure.
<ce> You leave the map in the snow.

Message:  1012
<ce> The instructions explain how to find ___dung_,
<ce> where the treasure is to be found. It contains
<ce> a warning that pirates are suspected to arrive
<ce> in about =timer_ days to move it to another location.
<ce> If you intend to collect the treasure, it'll have
<ce> to be before then.
