<ce> YES! Give me that! Step away! Get out
<ce> of here! Yes, here, money, take it!

Message:  1010
<ce> A hooded figure interrupts you and speaks
<ce> in a low voice.
<ce>
<ce> "'Scuse me stranger, I've got a little bit
<ce> of something that needs to get to a
<ce> house here in town. Pays =reward_
<ce> gold if you know how to sneak about it."

Message:  1011
<ce> "That's good. Place is _res_,
<ce> to the %di. Guards are gonna get word of
<ce> it soon and they'll be searching the area.
<ce> Might wanna deliver it fast, unless you
<ce> know you're a world-class sneak.
<ce> If it's not there in six hours
<ce> your money is forfeit. Give it to _person_."

Message:  1012
<ce> Six hours have passed and you did not deliver
<ce> the _ingred_ to _res_.

Message:  1013
<ce> The figure departs in silence.

Message:  1014
<ce> A member of the city watch approaches you
<ce> and gives you no quarter.
<ce> If you weren't such a good sneak, he might have
<ce> found the _ingred_ you were given. As you were properly
<ce> prepared, you suffer only a little jostling
<ce> before the guard leaves.

Message:  1015
<ce> A member of the city watch approaches you and gives
<ce> you no quarter. You thought you had a good hiding
<ce> place for the _ingred_, but it wasn't good enough.
<ce> He confiscates it and runs away, calling for your arrest.
<ce> Clearly you were not the sneak for this job.
