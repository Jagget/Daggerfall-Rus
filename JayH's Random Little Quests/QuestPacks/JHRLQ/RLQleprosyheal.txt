Message:  1010
<ce> A villager accosts you, covered in serious and repugnant
<ce> sores. He tells you that he has leprosy, and the
<ce> temple refuses to treat him for the severity of it.
<ce> Though he has nothing to pay you with, he begs for a cure,
<ce> as the illness rapidly consumes his life.
<ce>
<ce> Do you attempt to heal him?
<ce>
<ce> (YES: Skill check, Medical, high; or
<ce> (YES: Skill check, Restoration, medium)

Message:  1011
<ce> You turn away from the leper, hoping his affliction
<ce> doesn't affect you in some way.

Message:  1012
<ce> (SKILL CHECKS FAILED)
<ce>
<ce> You overestimate your abilities as you approach.
<ce> Just as the temple healers failed to cure him by magic,
<ce> you are also unable. Your medical skill is also lacking.
<ce> You make a few disappointing attempts, but achieve nothing.
<ce> Tears fill the man's eyes as he turns away,
<ce> waiting for another savior to arrive.

<ce> (ПРОВЕРКА НАВЫКА ПРОЙДЕНА: MEDICAL)
<ce>
<ce> His case is quite advanced, and a lesser physician would
<ce> be lost. But you've seen enough to know
<ce> an obvious cure. A nearby townsperson brings a few herbs at
<ce> your request, and you mix them to make a potion.
<ce> Upon drinking it, the leper is cured.
<ce> A few wide-eyed villagers watch in awe as his sores heal.
<ce>
<ce> "A miracle! It's a miracle! %oth!"
<ce>
<ce> He then runs through the streets, shouting for joy.
<ce> It appears your reputation in %crn
<ce> is about to improve a little.
