Message:  1011
<ce> A tired-looking warrior hails you.
<ce>
<ce> "Hi. I'm giving up on a task from the Fighters Guild
<ce> here in town to kill some rats infesting a house.
<ce> Turns out I got the plague halfway through and
<ce> have to spend my savings at the temple. If you
<ce> want to go in and clean the rest, I'll split
<ce> the reward with you. You in?"
                                     <--->
<ce> A warrior spattered with blood all around hails you.
<ce>
<ce> "Hail. I have an assignment from the Fighters Guild
<ce> to kill a few rats in a local house, but they're tougher
<ce> than I thought. Think I've got an illness. It'll take
<ce> everything I earned this week to get a cure, and I'm
<ce> not risking that again. Want take over the contract?
<ce> Kill the remaining rats and I'll split it with you,
<ce> half and half."

Message:  1012
<ce> "Maybe you're smarter than I am. This guild
<ce> doesn't have your back when things get bad."
<ce>
<ce> The wounded warrior heads off to find the temple.
                                     <--->
<ce> "Oh well. It was worth a shot."
<ce>
<ce> The fighter moves on to find a cure.
                                     <--->
<ce> "Maybe it's for the better. I should
<ce> head back to the farm."
<ce>
<ce> The warrior leaves you alone.

Message:  1013
<ce> "It's called _place_, %di from here.
<ce> I think there's about 18 hours left before
<ce> they call the contract. If you can kill them,
<ce> I'll come back and make sure you get the payment."
<ce>
<ce> The warrior heads off to find a cure.

Message:  1014
<ce> This is indeed the house.

<ce> Sounds like that's all of them.
<ce> You don't hear anything else moving in the house.
