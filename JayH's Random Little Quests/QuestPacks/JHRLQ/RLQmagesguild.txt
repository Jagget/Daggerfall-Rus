<ce> "Ah, good! I picked up this book when we raided
<ce> some bandits yesterday and I didn't know who I'd
<ce> give it to. You've got to make some use of it,
<ce> don't you? Take it, it's my gift! Farewell!"

<ce> "You there! Are you a member of the Mages Guild?"

Message:  1011
<ce> "I knew it! I'll have revenge on you people for what
<ce> you did to my village!"
<ce>
<ce> Ignorant though you may be to this incident,
<ce> you are nonetheless the scapegoat for whatever happened.
<ce> The warrior prepares for battle.

Message:  1012
<ce> "Phew, am I glad to hear that. Not enough mages around
<ce> here when we need the supernatural touch.
<ce> Stay safe, I imagine a mage's life isn't easy!"
<ce>
<ce> The warrior then marches off in a different direction.
<--->
<ce> "Wish I could buy you a pint, I'm off to help in a
<ce> bandit raid. Just wanted to thank you folks for
<ce> getting rid of all the spriggans 'round here.
<ce> Right abominations, they are! Farewell!"
<ce>
<ce> The warrior then hurries off.

Message:  1013
