<ce> A robed wizard with a rather confused demeanor bumbles
<ce> about nearby. His distance from reality seems
<ce> to vary with every passing moment. He stumbles close
<ce> enough to focus his eyes on you, and then speaks.
<ce>
<ce> "%hnr, I have a fine _item_ here, enchanted with
<ce> powerful magicks. I can't remember what the enchantment
<ce> is, or I'd be selling it for a lot more. For just 750
<ce> gold pieces, it's all yours for the taking".
<ce>
<ce> Do you purchase the magic _item_?

Message:  1014
