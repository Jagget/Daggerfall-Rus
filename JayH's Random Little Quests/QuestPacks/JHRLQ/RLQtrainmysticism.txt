QuestComplete:   [1004]
<ce> After feeding in 300 gold pieces, you sit down
<ce> and survey the contents of the book.
<ce> It has far more material than even three hours could
<ce> cover. You gain what you can from it, and when
<ce> your allotted time is over, the tome disappears from
<ce> view along with the pouch.

Message:  1010
<ce> You notice a book chained to a nearby wall,
<ce> replete with magical seals. Next to it hangs
<ce> a pouch with a note.
<ce>
<ce> "300 gold to read book for three hours.
<ce> Learn the fine art of mysticism.
<ce> Book will be relocated at owner's pleasure".
<ce>
<ce> The pouch is just barely open enough to fit
<ce> coins into its mouth. Do you take advantage
<ce> of the opportunity?

Message:  1011
<ce> You continue on without trying it. After a few
<ce> moments you look back by chance and notice that
<ce> the book and pouch are no longer visible.

Message:  1012
<ce> You search and search but cannot find 300 gold
<ce> coins among your things. You'll have to forego
<ce> the lesson this time. After a few
<ce> moments you look back by chance and notice that
<ce> the book and pouch are no longer visible.
