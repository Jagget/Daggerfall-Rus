<ce> moments, would you do some problems with me?
<ce> I have some spare money here as payment
<ce> if you want to help me work through them."

<ce> "Yes, of course it's nine. I shouldn't even be hesitating.
<ce> Sorry, a little nervous here.
<ce> Okay, next part. Three times four is fourteen, right?"

<ce> "You're right, not fourteen. Yes, let me correct that. The formula works out!
<ce>
<ce> "Okay, next section. Fifteen times five... is seventy five?"
                                     <--->
<ce> "You're right, not fourteen. Yes, let me correct that. The formula works out!
<ce>
<ce> "Okay, next section. Two hundred and fifty divided by ten is... twenty five?"

Message:  1014
<ce> "Good! Yes, the formula continues. Let me carry over that value.
<ce>Um, this next part. One hundred divided by five is twenty, isn't it?"
                                     <--->
<ce> "Good! Yes, the formula continues. Let me carry over that value.
<ce> Um, this next part. Twenty-two divided by eleven has to be two, isn't it?"

<ce> "Okay, almost done. Now I just need to find the circumference...
<ce> oh bother. Um, this circle... No, the diameter. Hold on.
<ce> Yes, the diameter of a circle that's twelve meters long.
<ce> Is that six meters?"
                                     <--->

<ce> Yes, the diameter of a circle that's twenty meters long.
<ce> Is that ten meters?"

Message:  1016
<ce> Your patron takes a moment and incorporates that answer
<ce> into the next question. However, the answer doesn't fit,
<ce> and soon the whole formula begins to malfunction.
<ce> Once it is discovered that your guidance was wrong,
<ce> any promise of payment is null and void.
<ce> The book is closed and the activity is over.
