<ce> Hail, %ra. Have time for a game?
<ce> It's very simple. You pay 100 gold, non-refundable,
<ce> and we flip a coin. If heads is up, I pay you 200.
<ce> If heads is down, I keep your money.
<ce> You can keep doubling as long as you get heads up,
<ce> but if you ever get a heads down, I take it all.
<ce> Want to put down a hundred?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce> Maybe a wise choice, friend.
